#Plot recreational activities in Seneca, SC

#Plot

#1. I chose Seneca, SC for this assignment because it is my hometown, and I am very familiar with the area. Seneca is surrounded by two lakes, as well as Clemson University, so it lends itself to lots of tourism. I searched for hotels, and recreational activity businesses.
#2. There are 36 businesses in total for these 2 categories.
#3. There are 8 hotels, and 28 recreational activity businesses.
#4. Many of the recreational businesses are located near the lake. Oftentimes, people visit to rent boats, and enjoy a weekend on Lake Keowee. Additionally, many recreational businesses are located in the heart of Downtown Seneca, near the historic "Ram Cat Alley." This alley is home to a number of businesses, and is a growing hub of activity for Seneca. Additionally, the majority of hotels are located along Highway 123. This highway provides easy access to Clemson University, as well as Interstate I-85.
